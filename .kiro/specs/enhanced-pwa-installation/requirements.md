# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced PWA Installation Prompts feature will improve user adoption and engagement by providing intelligent, contextual prompts that encourage users to install the Job Tracker as a Progressive Web App on their devices. This feature builds upon the existing PWA foundation (manifest.json and Service Worker) to create a seamless installation experience that respects user preferences and provides clear value propositions for app installation.

The feature will include smart timing for installation prompts, custom UI that matches the application's dark theme, installation analytics, and cross-platform support while maintaining the privacy-first, client-side approach of the Job Tracker application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a job seeker using the Job Tracker, I want to be prompted to install the app at appropriate times, so that I can access my job tracking data more conveniently and have a native app-like experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has used the application for at least 3 sessions AND has added at least 2 job applications THEN the system SHALL display an installation prompt
2. WHEN a user dismisses an installation prompt THEN the system SHALL not show the prompt again for at least 7 days
3. WHEN a user clicks "Not Now" on an installation prompt THEN the system SHALL track this preference and delay future prompts
4. WHEN a user successfully installs the app THEN the system SHALL never show installation prompts again
5. IF the browser does not support PWA installation THEN the system SHALL not display installation prompts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the installation prompt to clearly explain the benefits of installing the app, so that I can make an informed decision about installation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an installation prompt is displayed THEN the system SHALL show clear benefits including "Offline Access", "Faster Loading", "Desktop/Mobile Icon", and "No Browser Tabs"
2. WHEN displaying the installation prompt THEN the system SHALL use the application's existing dark theme and blue accent colors

4. WHEN a user hovers over or focuses on the install button THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback consistent with the app's design
5. WHEN displaying on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL optimize the prompt layout for smaller screens

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have control over installation prompts, so that I can choose when or if I want to install the app without being repeatedly bothered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Install Now" THEN the system SHALL trigger the native browser installation flow
2. WHEN a user clicks "Not Now" THEN the system SHALL dismiss the prompt and record the dismissal
3. WHEN a user clicks "Don't Ask Again" THEN the system SHALL permanently disable installation prompts for this user
4. WHEN a user has dismissed prompts 3 times THEN the system SHALL automatically enable "Don't Ask Again" behavior
5. IF a user wants to manually trigger installation THEN the system SHALL provide an option in the Settings menu

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the installation process to work consistently across different browsers and devices, so that I have a reliable experience regardless of my platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Chrome/Edge on desktop THEN the system SHALL use the beforeinstallprompt event for installation
2. WHEN using Safari on iOS THEN the system SHALL provide instructions for manual installation via "Add to Home Screen"
3. WHEN using Firefox THEN the system SHALL detect PWA support and provide appropriate installation guidance
4. WHEN the browser supports installation but the prompt event is not available THEN the system SHALL show manual installation instructions
5. WHEN installation is not supported THEN the system SHALL gracefully hide all installation-related UI

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Job Tracker, I want to track installation prompt effectiveness, so that I can optimize the installation experience and understand user adoption patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an installation prompt is shown THEN the system SHALL log the event with timestamp to localStorage
2. WHEN a user interacts with the prompt (install, dismiss, don't ask again) THEN the system SHALL record the action and outcome
3. WHEN a user successfully installs the app THEN the system SHALL track the installation completion
4. WHEN viewing analytics in the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display installation prompt metrics in a dedicated section
5. IF the user exports analytics data THEN the system SHALL include installation metrics in the export

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user who has already installed the app, I want the installation prompts to be automatically disabled, so that I don't see irrelevant prompts after installation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is running in standalone mode (installed) THEN the system SHALL never display installation prompts
2. WHEN the app detects it's running as an installed PWA THEN the system SHALL hide all installation-related UI elements
3. WHEN a user accesses the app through the installed version THEN the system SHALL update the user's installation status
4. WHEN the app is launched from an installed icon THEN the system SHALL record this as a successful installation if not already tracked
5. IF the user uninstalls and later visits the web version THEN the system SHALL re-enable installation prompts after the standard criteria are met
